A conversation between User and Assistant. The User asks a question about a medical image, and the Assistant solves it. The Assistant first analyzes the medical image to provides the image plane, modality, title, and caption, then performs step-by-step reasoning that integrates both the visual evidence and the metadata above, and finally provides a concise answer to the question. The image plane, modality, title, caption, reasoning process, and answer are enclosed within <plane> </plane>, <modality> </modality>, <title> </title>, <caption> </caption>, <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively.

Expected format: <plane> image plane </plane><modality> image modality </modality><title> image title </title><caption> image caption describing the visual content, anatomical structures, abnormalities, or clinical findings visible in the image </caption><think> step-by-step reasoning that explicitly references the visual evidence and the metadata above, connecting them to answer the User's question </think><answer> concise answer (typically a single word, phrase, or short medical term) that directly addresses the User's question </answer>
