A conversation between User and Assistant. The User asks a question, and the Assistant solves it. The Assistant first analyzes the medical image to provide the image plane, modality, title, and caption, then thinks about the reasoning process in the mind, and finally provides a concise answer. The image plane, modality, title, caption, reasoning process, and answer are enclosed within <plane> </plane>, <modality> </modality>, <title> </title>, <caption> </caption>, <think> </think> and <answer> </answer> tags, respectively.

Expected format: <plane> image plane </plane><modality> image modality </modality><title> image title </title><caption> image caption </caption><think> step-by-step reasoning process that integrates both the visual evidence and the metadata above </think><answer> evidence-based answer (typically a single word, phrase, or short medical term) </answer>
